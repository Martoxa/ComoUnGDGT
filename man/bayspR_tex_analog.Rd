\usage{
bayspR_tex_analog(
  gdgt,
  prior_mean,
  prior_std,
  search_tol,
  runname,
  varargin = 1000,
  data = "raw",
  complete = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdgt}{A matrix of HPLC-MS peak area values (15xN) or (Nx15), or a
scalar vector of MBT'5Me values (1xN) or (Nx1).}

\item{prior_mean}{Prior mean on temperature. Assumed same for all.}

\item{prior_std}{Prior standard deviation for temperature. Assumed same for all.}

\item{search_tol}{Tolerance for finding analog locations. Comparison is between the mean of dats and the mean TEX value within each large gridcell.}

\item{runname}{Enter 'SST' for sea-surface temperature or 'subT' for subsurface T.}

\item{varargin}{Used to set the number of posterior draws of parameters to
mix across, and whether to save the 5th/50th/95th percentiles of the
predictions, or the whole ensemble as well. If left empty, then 1000 draws
are used and the ensemble of predictions is not saved. If only one argument,
it is the number of draws (cannot exceed 15000), and the ensemble is not
saved. Nothe that samples are thinned to use the full span of the ensemble.
If two arguments, the first gives the number of draws, while the second is
an indicator: 0 (default) or 1, will save the 5th/50th/95th percentiles
only, or the full ensemble, respectively. In all the above, the total
number of ensemble members is capped by the number of draws in the model
output.}

\item{data}{A string corresponding the type of data to run in the model.
Options are "raw" or "tex", which use peak areas or fractional abundances,
or TEX86 values, respectively.}

\item{complete}{Determines how is TEX86 calculated. TRUE calculates exactly
as per Schouten, et al., 2002 (default). FALSE ommits missing compounds. A
warning is generated and the ommitted compounds are shown.
prior mean is set as the mean over all instrumental SST observations
within max_dist (distance is chordal), or the closest min_num points:
whichever has the larger number of observations.
To use the closest K points, set min_num=K and max_dist=0.
to use all points within L km, set min_num=1 (ensure at least one) and
max_dist=L. Results from the paper are with min_num=1; max_dist=500;}
}
\value{
Predictions      - Nd by 3 array, where Nd=length(dats), giving the 5/50/95
percentiles of the predictions.

AnLocs=- Centroids of the grid cells selected as analogs, as [lon,
lat] pairs

PriorMean - The prior mean as calculated above.

PriorStd  - The prior std as input.

PredsEns  - Nd by No. analog locatioins by Nsamps array of predictions. Only included if
ens_sel==1. Note that the second dimension corresponds to the locations in .AnLocs.

\description{
The assumption in this case is that oceanographic conditions are sufficiently dissimilar to the modern configuration (e.g. due to tectonic changes) so as to preclude the use of the regression parameters that correspond to the current location of the study site (see Tierney and Tingley, 2014, GCA for details).
